        "* **event**: Type of event the game was played \n",
        "* **site**: Where the game was played \n",

        "* **UTCdate** : date in UTC format\n",
        "* **UTCtime**: time the game was played in UTC format\n",
        "* **White**: username of the White player\n",

A positive value indicates White player has a better position, a negative value indicates Black has a better position. \n",
        "  If unit is 'mate', then 'value' is the number of moves until checkmate. A positive value indicates that White player can checkmate in 'value' moves, a negative value, that Black player can checkmate in 'value' moves. \n",
